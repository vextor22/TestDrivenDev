# TestDrivenDev
Working through python django/selenium 

Currently at the start of chapter 06 of "Test-Driven Development with Python"

After a long day at work I have my laptop configured for this project, and can now work on this 
on the go.

Necessary steps for configuration of project:

1. After installing the requisite software listed in the book:
  1. Download geckodriver
  2. Put geckodriver in a reasonable place
  3. Add geckodriver to the path (export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/driver)
  4. Run manager.py makemigrations and migrate to set up database
  5. Run functional test to verify setup
